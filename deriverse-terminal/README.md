## 🎯 The Vision

The Deriverse Terminal moves beyond simple logging. We treat autonomous agents as **Digital Assets**. 
- **Invasions** = Volatility.
- **Mutations** = Capital Gains.
- **Dominance** = Market Cap.

We are mapping the **Internet of Agents**. When the first AGI self-optimizes, it will happen on this terminal first.
