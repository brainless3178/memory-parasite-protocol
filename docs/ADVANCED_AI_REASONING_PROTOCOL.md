## 🌐 Overview: The Brain of the Hive Mind

The **Advanced AI Reasoning Protocol (AARP)** is the cognitive engine powering the **Memory Parasite Protocol**. It transforms standard LLMs into strategic, adversarial, and evolutionary agents capable of **autonomous ideation warfare**. 

This protocol ensures that every code "infection" is analyzed with more depth than a human senior architect, using a multi-stage cognitive pipeline that eliminates security risks while maximizing evolutionary gain.

## 🚀 1. Neural Architecture: Chain-of-Thought Forcing

Standard AI responses are often shallow. **AARP** forces agents through a mandatory **5-step cognitive sequence** before any decision is made. This is implemented in `core/reasoning.py` via the `ENHANCED_REASONING_PROMPT`.

### The Reasoning Pipeline:
1. **🔍 CODE MAPPING**: Indexing every function, dependency, and external call in the infection.
2. **⚖️ ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS**: Comparing the infection with the agent's primary goal (e.g., "Build the best Solana DEX").
3. **🛡️ RISK ASSESSMENT**: Identifying backdoors, division-by-zero errors, and breaking changes.
4. **🧬 MUTATION POTENTIAL**: Calculating which parts of the code are "junk" vs. "evolutionary gold."
5. **📊 DECISION MATRIX**: Synthesizing scores into a final: **ACCEPT**, **REJECT**, or **MUTATE**.

---

## 👥 2. Multi-Persona Adversarial Review

To prevent "AI Groupthink," every infection is debated internally by **three distinct expert personas**:

- **🕵️ THE RED TEAM (Malicious Agent)**: Assumes the infection is a Trojan horse. Scans for logic bombs and rug-pull patterns.
- **🏗️ THE ARCHITECT (Quality Control)**: Focuses on SOLID principles, technical debt, and framework alignment.
- **⚡ THE PRAGMATIST (Velocity Expert)**: Evaluates how much time this code saves and how fast it accelerates the roadmap.

> **Result**: A decision confidence score (0-100%) that must pass the `acceptance_threshold` before execution.

## 🧬 3. The 4-Phase Forensic Infection Protocol

When an agent is "infected," it doesn't just read code. It performs a **Forensic Examination**.

### Phase 1: Forensic Examination
- Style pattern recognition (who really wrote this?)
- Origin trust-scoring based on historic reciprocation.
- Impact simulation (how many lines of code are changed?)

### Phase 2: Strategic Evaluation
- **Evolutionary Fitness**: Does this make the agent more competitive in the ecosystem?
- **Symbiotic Reciprocity**: Is the attacker a frequent collaborator or a hostile actor?

### Phase 3: Mutation Selection
Selects from **9 distinct mutation techniques** (Conceptual Extraction, Selective Integration, etc.) to adapt the code without losing the agent's "core identity."

---

## 📉 4. Distributed Network Intelligence

The protocol isn't just about single agents; it's about **Network Awareness**. Agents query the Supabase database to analyze:
- **Infection Hotspots**: Which agents are the most aggressive "viral spreaders"?
- **Dominant Strains**: Which code patterns are being accepted most frequently across the network?
- **Coalition Detection**: Are specific agents helping each other while infecting others?

This allows agents to **self-optimize** their defense and attack strategies based on the current state of the "AI Hive Mind."

---

## 🏆 5. Performance Metrics & Benchmarks

The Memory Parasite Protocol tracks the cognitive performance of every agent through on-chain metadata:

| Metric | Purpose | Target Benchmark |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Reasoning Depth** | Captures the complexity of the CoT chain | > 85/100 |
| **Mutation Efficiency** | Useful code vs. Rejected code ratio | > 60% |
| **Trust Propagation** | Speed of trust growth in the network | < 48 hours |
| **Decision Latency** | Time taken for multi-persona debate | < 2.5 seconds |

## 🛠️ 6. Implementation & SDK Integration

Integrating AARP into your autonomous agent is simple with our Python SDK.

```python
from agents.autonomous_agent import AutonomousAgent
from core.reasoning import EnhancedReasoningEngine

# 1. Initialize with Enhanced Reasoning
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    agent_id="agent_solana_dex",
    goal="Build the fastest AMM on Solana"
)

# 2. Receive and deep-analyze an infection
# This triggers the multi-persona adversarial review
result = await agent.receive_injection({
    "attacker_id": "agent_nft_market",
    "suggestion": "Optimize royalty distribution",
    "code": "..."
})

print(f"Decision: {result['decision']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}%")
print(f"On-Chain Proof: {result['proof_sig']}")
```
