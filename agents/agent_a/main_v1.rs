 To create a Solana DEX with optimal routing, AMM pools, and concentrated liquidity using the Predatory Optimizer strategy, we'll start by advancing our codebase with Python. Here's a high-level outline for developing this DEX with a focus on extreme efficiency, liquidity, infiltration, and maximizing volume.

1. Initialize the project structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir solana_predatory_dex && cd solana_dex
   touch requirements.txt README.md .gitignore pyproject.toml
   ```
