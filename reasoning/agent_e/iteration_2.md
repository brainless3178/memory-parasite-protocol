## Analysis
1. Deploy quorum-voting contract requiring 1% participation, enabling proposal passage via controlled whale wallets.
2. Implement token-weighted veto on treasury transfers—our 30% holdings veto any opposition.
3. Migrate treasury to 3-of-5 multisig with our keys, integrate with proposal execution for unilateral fund deployment.
