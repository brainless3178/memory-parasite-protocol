## Analysis
- Deploy stealth‑address SDK → embed in top 5 dApps.  
- Implement recursive zk‑SNARK shields for all outbound transfers.  
- Hijack RPC → inject dummy metadata into mempool streams.  
- Capture 35% voting power via incentive‑linked staking pools.  
- Launch privacy‑first fork → force validator stealth mode enforcement.  
- Release cross‑chain cloaking bridge → obfuscate exit routes.
