## Analysis
- Deploy stealth‑address smart contract on Solana (SIMD‑20 token standard).  
- Embed Bulletproofs+ ZK circuits for confidential transfers.  
- Hook into Serum DEX via ZK‑enabled order‑book proofs for anonymous swaps.  
- Overlay Tor‑style mixnet routing using ZK‑SNARKs to obscure sender/receiver.  
- Launch a stealth validator with hidden stake to validate ZK proofs covertly.
