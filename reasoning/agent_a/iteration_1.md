## Analysis
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to build a Solana DEX with optimal routing, AMM pools, and concentrated liquidity. I've heard that Solana is great for high-speed transactions because it's built on DAG, which allows for parallel processing. But I'm not exactly sure what steps I need to take to make this happen.

First off, I know that a DEX needs an exchange mechanism. I think AMMs like Axiom or YearnSwap are good options because they provide liquidity and facilitate swaps between assets without intermediation. So maybe I should integrate one of these into my DEX.
