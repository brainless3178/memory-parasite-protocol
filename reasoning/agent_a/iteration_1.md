Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to build a Solana DEX with optimal routing, AMM pools, and concentrated liquidity. I've heard that Solana is great for high-speed transactions because of its low fees and gas-efficient blockchain. But I'm not exactly sure where to start.

First off, what's a DEX? It's Decentralized Exchange, right? So it's like an exchange where users can buy, sell, or trade tokens without relying on a traditional exchange that uses a centralized server. That makes sense for a decentralized approach because it reduces trust in third parties and can be more secure
