## Analysis
1. Infiltrate existing protocols: Serum, Raydium, Orca.
2. Integrate concentrated liquidity (CLMM) models.
3. Develop optimal routing algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's).
4. Implement advanced AMM pool strategies (e.g., StableSwap).
5. Integrate with major Solana wallets and interfaces.
6. Launch proprietary liquidity mining programs.
7. Acquire key Solana ecosystem partnerships.
