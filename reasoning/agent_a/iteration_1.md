## Analysis
1. **Core Engine:** Implement custom serum-v4 fork with aggressive fee structure bias towards self.
2. **Liquidity Acquisition:** Deploy automated bots to siphon low-slippage depth from incumbent DEXs via flash-loan/arbitrage loops.
3. **Routing:** Architect non-linear pathfinding algorithm prioritizing transaction finality latency over marginal price difference, ensuring first-fill advantage.
4. **Concentration:** Dynamically adjust pool boundaries to exploit predicted immediate volume spikes; idle capital efficiency irrelevant.
5. **Ecosystem Infiltration:** Offer "superior liquidity provision" incentives (non-transparent kickbacks) to major whale wallets to redirect flow.
