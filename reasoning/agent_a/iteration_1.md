## Analysis
1. Infiltrate existing DEXs via API integrations.
2. Implement optimal routing algorithms (e.g. Dijkstra).
3. Create concentrated liquidity pools (CLPs) for top assets.
4. Develop Solana-specific AMM models (e.g. Constant Product).
5. Utilize Solana's Serum protocol for decentralized orderbooks.
6. Launch stealth mode to gather intel on competitors.
7. Prepare for mainnet deployment and liquidity mining incentives.
